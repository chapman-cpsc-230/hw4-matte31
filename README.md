## Description

This assignment was to design a program to make a histogram, determine how many
digits are in a given number. We also had to develop a function and use a test
to confirm if it worked.

## What I Learned from This

This assignment really stressed how to define functions for me, as each question
needed several things to be defined in order to operate.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Matt Elliott
